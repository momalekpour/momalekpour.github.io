      I'm Mo, a MSc researcher at Data & AI Systems Lab (DAIS) in Polytechnique Montreal and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, focusing on the application of Artificial Intelligence in Data Systems. My research aims to enhance data management practices through innovative AI solutions, particularly in area of Text-to-SQL.

      ## Research Interests:
      
          * AI-powered Software Engineering
          * Data Management
          * Information Retrieval
          * Text-to-SQL
          * Database Systems

      Currently, I'm Graduate Research Assistant at Polytechnique Montreal and Mila. Previously, I've built data pipelines and dashboards at Divar (an e-commerce platform with 30M+ monthly active users), did two internships in software engineering at Segmentino and IPM, and completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with minor in Economics at AmirKabir University of Technology.

      سلام! i'm Mo, currently doing my MSc at Polytechnique Montreal and Mila!

      ## the main quest:

        * making AI models actually useful for software/data engineering
        * hanging out with ma Claudes
        * learning systems programming and DBs internals for fun/pain

      ## stack:

        * backend development enthusiast \( ﾟヮﾟ)/
        * data systems enjoyer ( ´∀`)v
        * c++ sufferer (¬_¬")
        * rust evangelist? (¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

      ## speedrun:

      started as a computer science student at AmirKabir University, software engineer intern at IPM and then Segmentino, built data pipelines and dashboards at Divar, did some text-to-sql at PolyMTL, and now wrestling with my Master's thesis.

      if i'm not dropping PRs or putting a curse on reviewer 2, i'm yelling at Anthropic for their rate limits.

      > By the Omnissiah's will, I labor in:

        + Cog-Integrated Software Rites (AI-powered SE)
        + Sacred Data Vaults and Query Engines (Database Systems)
        + Rituals of Natural Language Translation (Text-to-SQL)
        + High Lexicons of the Lingua Ex Machina (LLMs in SE)

      > Past services to the Omnissiah:

        + Forged sacred data conduits and cogitator dashboards at Divar's e-commerce shrine (30M+ souls served).
        + Performed ritual software incantations as an initiate at Segmentino and IPM.
        + Consecrated my foundation in the Machine Cult at AmirKabir's Techno-Seminary.

      > My current pilgrimage leads me through the hallowed data-vaults of Polytechnique Montreal and Mila, where I commune with Text-to-SQL machine spirits and architect AI constructs for the glory of the Omnissiah.

    description: "SQLMorph is a mutation-based framework for robust, reproducible Text-to-SQL evaluation. It tackles limits of public benchmarks and the cost/instability of private sets by automatically generating/expanding evaluation data via (1) Join Query Expansion (JQE), which systematically adds semantically valid joins to raise structural complexity, and (2) Textual Query Augmentation (TQA), which applies controlled natural-language perturbations to probe linguistic robustness. These create targeted “choke points”: on state-of-the-art models, JQE increases coverage and exposes accuracy decay as join count grows, while TQA surfaces brittleness. Beyond datasets, SQLMorph introduces relaxed execution-level metrics—Execution Precision (EXP), Execution Recall (EXR), and their F1—to capture partial correctness."

    description: "Text-to-SQL enables users to interact with databases through natural language, simplifying access to structured data. Although highly capable large language models (LLMs) achieve strong accuracy for complex queries, they incur unnecessary latency and dollar cost for simpler ones. In this paper, we introduce the first LLM routing approach for Text-to-SQL, which dynamically selects the most cost-effective LLM capable of generating accurate SQL for each query. We present two routing strategies (score- and classification-based) that achieve accuracy comparable to the most capable LLM while reducing costs. We design the routers for ease of training and efficient inference. In our experiments, we highlight a practical and explainable accuracy-cost trade-off on the BIRD dataset."

    description: "Concrete design often overuses cement to guarantee 28-day strength, even when many structural elements, like foundations and pavements, reach full load much later. This study uses machine learning to optimize cement content for a 90-day strength target, reducing waste and emissions. Using ANN, deep learning, and regression models trained on 28- and 90-day compressive strength data, we predict optimal cement content with up to 94% accuracy. Elastic Net achieves the best results, showing potential for ~10% reductions in both cement use and carbon footprint."

    description: "DailyDiet is a full-stack nutrition management platform that helps users plan meals, calculate daily calorie needs, and explore recipes tailored to their goals. I was responsible for leading all backend development — building a scalable RESTful API with Flask and PostgreSQL to handle user authentication, dynamic diet generation, and recipe indexing. The backend features a dynamic-programming–based diet recommendation engine, JWT-secured user accounts, and Elasticsearch integration for semantic and ingredient-based recipe search. I also managed deployment and infrastructure setup on Heroku, and designed the data models for user tracking and admin moderation. The API powers the Vue.js + Nuxt web frontend and the companion iOS app."
